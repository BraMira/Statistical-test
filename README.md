# TO DO:
- [x] meet with proposer

- [x] compute the first statistical test to see how long it takes to compute a single value and how many computations you need for a decent histogram
- [x] compute the rest of the table
- [x] generate all the tables
- [ ] compare it with a classical statistical test (which one)
- [ ] How does variance affect the test
- [ ] can we improve our test?
